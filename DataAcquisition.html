            <p1 class="spacing r-text">The variables are split into two categories: categorical and quantitative.</p1>
        </div>
        <div class="block data_text">
            <p> <B>Categorical</B> variables (also called <I>qualitative</I> variables) are variables that take on a certain number 
                based on its qualitative property.<br>
                Example: On a 6 sided die, there are 6 options: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are 6 options available.
                <I>Do not confuse this with quantitative variables. Even though the pips on a die are numbers, they represent
                    different categories, which therefore make them categorical.
                </I>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block data_text">
            <p>The first of the <B>quantitative</B> variables is called a discrete variable. In statistics, a discrete variable
                is categorized as an enumerable list of values or possibilities of all numbers in a list. <br>
                Example: Suppose we are counting bears in a forest. The variable <I>bears</I> is a discrete variable because
                there could be one or zero bears in the forest, but there also could be one million. We are just unsure. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block data_text">
            <p>The second of the <B>quantitative</B> variables is called a continuous variable. A continuous variable
            is defined as not being a finite number. This means that it is <I>usually</I> not a round or whole number.<br>
            Example: Suppose you are running a race; your time may be recorded to the 
        nearest hundreth of a second, but your race time is continuous, as there is still yet
    to be determined the thousandth, ten thousandth, hundred thousandth, etc second of your race time.  </p>
