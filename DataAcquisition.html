            <p1 class="spacing r-text">The variables are split into two categories: categorical and quantitative.</p1>
        </div>
        <div class="block1 data_text">
            <p> <B>Categorical</B> variables (also called <I>qualitative</I> variables) are variables that take on a certain number 
                based on its qualitative property.<br>
                Example: On a 6 sided die, there are 6 options: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are 6 options available.
                <I>Do not confuse this with quantitative variables. Even though the pips on a die are numbers, they represent
                    different categories, which therefore make them categorical.
                </I>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block1 data_text">
            <p>The first of the <B>quantitative</B> variables is called a discrete variable. In statistics, a discrete variable
                is categorized as an enumerable list of values or possibilities of all numbers in a list. <br>
                Example: Suppose we are counting bears in a forest. The variable <I>bears</I> is a discrete variable because
                there could be one or zero bears in the forest, but there also could be one million. We are just unsure. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block1 data_text">
            <p>The second of the <B>quantitative</B> variables is called a continuous variable. A continuous variable
            is defined as not being a finite number. This means that it is <I>usually</I> not a round or whole number.<br>
            Example: Suppose you are running a race; your time may be recorded to the 
        nearest hundreth of a second, but your race time is continuous, as there is still yet
    to be determined the thousandth, ten thousandth, hundred thousandth, etc second of your race time.  </p>

        <div class="spacing r-text">Types of distributions: graphs and charts<br>
        A distribution of a variable gives the value along with its frequency</div>
        <div class="data_text left-text">
            <p>We use bar charts for categorical data and histograms for quantitative data. <br>
            If a graph is not symmetric, then it is considered skewed. <br>
            <li><B>Right skew</B>: tail points to right (mean is larger than the median)</li>
            <li><B>Left skew</B>: tail points to left (median is larger than the mean)</li><br>
            Make sure to take note of the shape of a graph when observing it:
            <li>Number of nodes</li>
            <li>Type of symmetry</li>
            <li>Pattern</li>
            <li>Deviation of pattern (also called outliers)</li><br>
            Other things to know: 
            <li>Interpolation does not work for categorical data</li>
            <li>Sensitivity vs. Restraint: Data is said to be sensitive if it responds drastically to outliers</li>

            <p><B>Range</B> tells us how far apart the edges of our data are. This is found by subtracting the minimum from the maximum.</p>

        <div class="block1 data_text">
            <p><B>Interquartile Range</B>, also known as Q<sub>3</sub>-Q<sub>1</sub>, takes the first and third quartiles of the 5 number spread. It is said to be very resistant to outliers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block1 data_text">
            <p><B>Standard Deviation</B> is sensitive to outliers, but it is a way to measure how much a set of numbers vary from their average value. The equation is found below: <br>
            \( \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}} \), where: <br>
            <li>\( \sigma \) is the standard deviation</li>

                <p>Our 5 number spread consists of:

                <li>The median</li>
                <li>The first quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>)</li>
                <li>The minimum</li><br>
                The 1.5 IQR rule states that points are considered outliers if the whiskers exceed 1.5x the distance of the first and third quartiles. 
                If our data is symmetric and a bell shaped appearance, 95% of our data will lie 2 standard deviations on either end of the mean.
                <li>If a graph is flat, it is called uniform</li> <br>
                The Z-score is generally used when our data is symmetric and bell shaped. It measures the distance between a data point and the mean using standard deviations. <br>
                Z-score formula = $\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$</p>

                <p>Observation studies are studies that follow groups to compare and contrast characteristics. This does not include the observer changing anything about the study.<br>

               <p>Experimental studies are studies in which researchers manipulate explanatory variables (called factors). Features of experiments include: <br>
                <li>Control group</li>

                Example: A researcher wants to know if a pill actually lowers blood pressure. They divide a group of randomly chosen people into two groups, one group using the actual pill and the other taking a placebo. The results are then studied. <br> </p>
